## Introduction 

This project was sparked by the insights of Astrologers like Dr. Christof Niederwieser and Andre Barbault. With the world advancing into the 'Age of Air,' where technology surges and ancient wisdom resurfaces, I found myself combining my passion for coding and astrology.

Astrologers like Dr. Niederwieser predicted significant events, including the pandemic, years in advance. Astrology's track record in forecasting everything from wars to market trends intrigued me. So, I decided to bridge the esoteric world of astrology with practical business insights.

The idea is simple: offer a B2B service that combines the insights of major celestial bodies—Jupiter to Pluto—with hard data. The company synthesizes this into understandable narratives that help businesses expand, manage employees better, devise unique strategies, and boost profits. It's about applying ancient wisdom to modern challenges.

# **Strategy:** 

A B2B website. The primary goal of the website is to inform the visitor that this is a legitimate Data Analytics service, as well as educate potential customers of the potent insights astrology can provide. It is very important to show credibility, as well as reliability, with B2B businesses. They need to know why and how their business will gain more insight into their area of choice with this service, and not be alienated by the esoteric image astrology has in the west.

## Skeleton 

I had a mental idea of what I wanted to produce on screen.

## Surface 

As a B2B and B2C hybrid site, it was important to me to create a mainly simple and aesthetically pleasing website that invited the reader to indulge in the intriguing blend of two themes that usually don't go well together.

### Design 

#### Color Palette

- ##### Main Color Theme: Green
  - I chose green as the primary color theme for this website to symbolize Mercury, the planet associated with Analytics and Astrology, aligning with the core themes of the project.

- ##### Background Color: Neutral with Opacity
  - The background color is a neutral shade with opacity, rgba(238, 238, 238, 0.75), offering a subtle backdrop that doesn't distract from the content.

- ##### Nav and Footer Background Colors:
  - Larger screens: rgb(24, 61, 61)
  - Smaller screens with dropdown menus: rgb(201, 247, 230)
  - The use of different background colors ensures a responsive and visually appealing experience for users.

- ##### Footer Favicons:
  - The footer favicons are styled with the color blanchedalmond, which contrasts effectively with the green theme and adds a touch of uniqueness to the design.

- ##### Link Colors:
  - For dark backgrounds: rgb(201, 247, 230)
  - For light backgrounds: rgb(24, 61, 61)
  - These link colors provide clear visibility and consistency in design across different sections of the website.

- ##### Call to Action Button Color:
  - The Call to Action Button is styled with the color rgb(199, 238, 223), making it visually prominent and encouraging user interaction.

- ##### Active Color:
  - An active color of rgb(201, 247, 230) is used to emphasize interactive elements and provide visual feedback to users.

---

The color palette carefully chosen for this website combines symbolism, readability, and aesthetic appeal. Green, representing Mercury, is the main theme, creating a meaningful connection to the project's core concepts. The use of various background colors, link colors, and button styles ensures an engaging and user-friendly design. Additionally, the neutral background with opacity adds a subtle touch to the overall aesthetic.

![Image of HTML form Validation](assets/images/form_validated.png "Form Page validation")!

In the „Connect“ and „Form“ sections, there was an issue displayed with the „charset“ meta attribute, as well as multiple stray trailing slashes that had to be removed. 

After clearing them up, I got everything validated.

## Responsivity

The responsive design covers a wide range of devices, from small screens with a width of 325px to large screens with up to 5k resolution.

## Testing

- **Navigation Menu:** I verified that the navigation menu functions correctly and that all links lead to the intended pages and sections.

- **Internal Links:** All internal links were tested for accuracy and functionality.

- **External Links:** There are no external Links

### Responsive Design and Cross-Device Testing

- **Screen Sizes:** I conducted testing across a wide range of screen sizes and resolutions, from small mobile devices to large desktop monitors through devtools and my phone. The website displayed consistently and responsively across all screen sizes.

- **Cross-Browser Compatibility:** I tested the website on different web browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge, to confirm compatibility and consistent rendering.

### User Experience and Feedback

- **Usability Testing:** I conducted usability testing with real users to evaluate the website's overall user experience. Participants provided feedback on navigation, layout, content, and ease of use.

- **Feedback Incorporation:** User feedback was  reviewed and incorporated into website improvements.

### Functional Form Testing

-**Contact Form:** The contact form was tested to ensure that users can submit inquiries and contact requests successfully.

- **Validation:** Form fields were tested for validation, including required fields, correct email format, and proper error messaging.

- **Submission:** I made test submissions to verify that form data is correctly received, processed, and sent.
